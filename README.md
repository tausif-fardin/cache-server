Hereâ€™s a sample README for your caching proxy application. You can modify it as needed to better fit your project's specifics.

# Caching Proxy Server

A simple caching proxy server built with Node.js, Express, and Axios. This server forwards requests to a specified origin server while caching responses for improved performance and reduced load on the origin server.

## Features

- **Caching**: Stores responses from the origin server to serve future requests quickly.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP address to prevent abuse.
- **Health Check**: Provides a health check endpoint to monitor server status.
- **Configurable Cache TTL**: Supports setting the cache time-to-live via environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed responses for different error scenarios.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caching-proxy-server.git
cd caching-proxy-server
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify the desired cache TTL (in seconds). For example:

```
CACHE_TTL=3600
```

## Usage

### Start the Server

Use the following command to start the caching proxy server, specifying the port and origin server URL:

```bash
npx yargs start --port <PORT> --origin <ORIGIN_URL>
```

For example:

```bash
npx yargs start --port 3000 --origin https://api.example.com
```

### Clear the Cache

To clear the cache, run:

```bash
npx yargs clear
```

### Health Check

You can check the server's health by visiting:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/health
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- **GET** `/health`
  - Returns a simple message indicating that the server is running.

### Proxy Requests

All requests to the caching proxy server will be forwarded to the specified origin server while caching the responses.

## Error Handling

The server provides appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for different types of errors, including:

- 500 Internal Server Error
- 504 Gateway Timeout (if no response from the origin server)
